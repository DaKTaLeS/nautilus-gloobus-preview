This extension map 'space' key to gloobus-preview (http://gloobus.net/)
and create a relative menu entry in nautilus.

What's gloobus-preview?
"Gloobus-Preview is an extension for the Gnome Desktop Environment 
designed to enable a full screen preview of any kind of file. It’s based 
on Apple’s “Quicklook”."

With my extension there's no need to install patched nautilus 
(nautilus-elementary), simply put it in nautilus-python extension dir 
and restart Nautilus.

	default on gentoo x86: /usr/lib/nautilus/extensions-2.0/python/

It's support localization, using "locale" dir (currently IT and EN only 
but feel free to contribuite).

Only dependence: dev-python/nautilus-python
(on gentoo it's called like above, in other distro dont'know)

TODO for next releases:
- Provide gentoo ebuild
- Support user-defined keybinding
- Add more Localization
